      <description>Abstract   Purpose of Review. Early, intensive, and high-quality interventions can often improve social communication outcomes for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Many children experience barriers to intervention, resulting in significant delays to intervention onset or missed opportunities for intervention altogether. With constant advances in technology, the field is experiencing a rapid increase in investigation of telehealth applications to intervention delivery. This article highlights the current trends in social communication intervention via telehealth used in early intervention practices for children with ASD over the past 5 years, including a brief review of studies (from 2014 to January 2020) and our team’s experiences in this area.</description>

      <title>Parent education to improve early language development: A preliminary evaluation of LENA Start™</title>

      <description>Abstract   Parents play an important role in creating home language environments that promote language development. A nonequivalent group design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based implementation of LENA Start™, a parent-training program aimed at increasing the quantity of adult words (AWC) and conversational turns (CT). Parent-child dyads participated in LENA Start™ (n = 39) or a generic parent education program (n = 17). Overall, attendance and engagement in the LENA Start™ program were high: 72% of participants met criteria to graduate from the program.</description>

      <title>Meeting in the Middle: Future Directions for Researchers to Support Educators’ Assessment Literacy and Data-Based Decision Making</title>
      <link>marianne-elmquist.com/publications/willetal2019/</link>

      <description>Abstract   Assessment is prevalent throughout all levels of education in the United States. Even though educators are familiar with the idea of assessing students, familiarity does not necessarily ensure assessment literacy, or data-based decision making (DBDM) knowledge. Assessment literacy and DBDM are critical in education, and early childhood education in particular, to identify and intervene on potential barriers to students&#39; development. Assessment produces data and evidence educators can use to inform intervention and instructional decisions to improve student outcomes.</description>

      <title>Impact of aided AAC interventions on speech comprehension of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities: A critically appraised topic</title>
      <link>marianne-elmquist.com/publications/elmquistetal2019/</link>

      <description>Abstract   A critically appraised topic (CAT) is one form of rapid review that can be particularly useful for informing practice. The purpose of this CAT was twofold: to determine (a) the impact of aided augmentative and alternative communication interventions on speech and graphic symbol comprehension in children, aged birth-18 years with neurodevelopmental disabilities and (b) whether there are any potential learner characteristics that serve as moderators or mediators regarding intervention outcomes.</description>

      <title>Maintenance and generalization in functional behavior assessment/behavior intervention plan literature.</title>
      <link>marianne-elmquist.com/publications/penningtonetal2019/</link>

      <description>Abstract   School practitioners increasingly use functional behavior assessments to design behavior intervention plans when students engage in challenging behavior that is not improved by classroom management or standard interventions. Behavior intervention plans should aim to produce behavior change that maintains across time and generalizes to relevant contexts. In applied terms, maintenance occurs when a behavior continues to occur after the intervention is fully or partially withdrawn; generalization occurs when a learner engages in a trained behavior in an untrained context.</description>

      <title>Toward an ecobehavioral model of early language development</title>
      <link>marianne-elmquist.com/publications/fordetal2020/</link>

      <description>Abstract   Language development is an important milestone in early childhood that has implications for laterachievement. Although a variety of contemporary models have been offered to describe the process oflanguage acquisition, ecobehavioral models provide descriptive and actionable information on both thecausal mechanisms of behavior change and development, as well as variables of influence (e.g., settings,environment, policies). Grounded within sociolinguistic theory and empirical literature, we propose anddescribe an ecobehavioral model of language development that assumes language is learned through theopportunities afforded by caregiver–child interactions.</description>

      <title>Promoting conditional use of communication skills for learners with complex communication needs: A tutorial</title>
      <link>marianne-elmquist.com/publications/simaceketal2018/</link>

      <description>Abstract   Purpose: Conditional use of communication skills refers to the ability of a learner to appropriately generalize and discriminate when, where, and how to communicate based on constant variation and shifts in environmental cues. Method: We describe discrimination and generalization challenges encountered by learners with complex communication needs and ways in which these challenges are fostered through traditional communication intervention programming. We address arrangements in instruction that maximize the probability of learners acquiring the conditional use of new vocabulary and the modest instructional technology implemented when planning for generalization.</description>

      <description>Abstract   Caregivers need support with teaching augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). The purpose of this study was to coach caregivers via telehealth (i.e., live video conferencing with Google Hangout) to implement communication assessments, functional communication training (FCT), and/or navigation training to address either idiosyncratic or problem behavior exhibited by two young boys with developmental delay (age 5.5 years) and autism (age 7 years) who were non-verbal. An adapted multiple probe design and a multiple probe design across three contexts (play, break from demands, help) were used to evaluate acquisition of communicative requests using high tech aided AAC on a speech-generating device (SGD; a Tobii Dynavox T10 device).</description>

      <title>Coaching parents to assess and treat self‐injurious behaviour via telehealth</title>
      <link>marianne-elmquist.com/publications/bensonetal2018/</link>

      <description>Abstract   The application of telehealth technology to conduct functional analysis (FA) and functional communication training (FCT) is emerging for children with developmental disabilities and behaviour support needs. The current study was designed to extend FA + FCT for self-injurious behaviour by using telehealth in home with parents as interventionists receiving real-time remote coaching. Two families with school-aged boys with developmental disabilities associated with intellectual disability participated, one with cerebral palsy and the other with autism spectrum disorder.</description>
