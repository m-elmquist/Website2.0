      <description>Project Description: During the first few years of my PhD program and part of my LEND Fellow pre-doctoral work, I worked with Jessica Simacek, Adel Dimian, and Joe Reichle on some projects evaluating parent-implemented communication interventions for children with complex communication needs (CCN) delivered via telehealth. In addition we collaborated on a number of reviews and tutorials. Some of this work also briefly overlapped with work I conducted with Jennifer McCommas.</description>

      <title>Impact of aided AAC interventions on speech comprehension of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities: A critically appraised topic</title>

      <description>Abstract   A critically appraised topic (CAT) is one form of rapid review that can be particularly useful for informing practice. The purpose of this CAT was twofold: to determine (a) the impact of aided augmentative and alternative communication interventions on speech and graphic symbol comprehension in children, aged birth-18 years with neurodevelopmental disabilities and (b) whether there are any potential learner characteristics that serve as moderators or mediators regarding intervention outcomes.</description>

      <description>Abstract   Caregivers need support with teaching augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). The purpose of this study was to coach caregivers via telehealth (i.e., live video conferencing with Google Hangout) to implement communication assessments, functional communication training (FCT), and/or navigation training to address either idiosyncratic or problem behavior exhibited by two young boys with developmental delay (age 5.5 years) and autism (age 7 years) who were non-verbal. An adapted multiple probe design and a multiple probe design across three contexts (play, break from demands, help) were used to evaluate acquisition of communicative requests using high tech aided AAC on a speech-generating device (SGD; a Tobii Dynavox T10 device).</description>

      <title>Coaching parents to assess and treat self‚Äêinjurious behaviour via telehealth</title>

      <description>Abstract   The application of telehealth technology to conduct functional analysis (FA) and functional communication training (FCT) is emerging for children with developmental disabilities and behaviour support needs. The current study was designed to extend FA + FCT for self-injurious behaviour by using telehealth in home with parents as interventionists receiving real-time remote coaching. Two families with school-aged boys with developmental disabilities associated with intellectual disability participated, one with cerebral palsy and the other with autism spectrum disorder.</description>
