      <description>IGDILab is part of an interdisciplinary, cross-institutional team of researchers developing, validating and applying Individual Growth and Development Indicators (IGDIs) to support data-based decision making to help improve early childhood outcomes. During my time at IGDIlab I primarily worked on the Age 3 IGDI&amp;rsquo;s project, but also briefly helped with the Progress Monitoring IGDI&amp;rsquo;s (PM-IGDIs) project.
Age-3-IGDIs     Project Description: The purpose of the current project was to downward extend IGDIs to three-year olds.</description>
