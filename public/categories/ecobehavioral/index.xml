      <description>Abstract   Language development is an important milestone in early childhood that has implications for laterachievement. Although a variety of contemporary models have been offered to describe the process oflanguage acquisition, ecobehavioral models provide descriptive and actionable information on both thecausal mechanisms of behavior change and development, as well as variables of influence (e.g., settings,environment, policies). Grounded within sociolinguistic theory and empirical literature, we propose anddescribe an ecobehavioral model of language development that assumes language is learned through theopportunities afforded by caregiverâ€“child interactions.</description>
