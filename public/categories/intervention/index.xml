      <description>During my Ph.D. I worked on a few projects with Liza Finestack in the Speech-Language-Hearing Science department at the University of Minnesota.
LENA Start™ Smarter Happier Baby Evaluation     Project Description: Along with Scott McConnell, Amanda Kriese, and Erin Lease, we ( Liza and myself) conducted a preliminary evaluation of LENA Start™ being implemented in community settings. We partnered with local Early Childhood Family Education (ECFE) programs to assess the feasibility of implementing LENA Start™ within ECFE classes.</description>

      <description>Project Description: During the first few years of my PhD program and part of my LEND Fellow pre-doctoral work, I worked with Jessica Simacek, Adel Dimian, and Joe Reichle on some projects evaluating parent-implemented communication interventions for children with complex communication needs (CCN) delivered via telehealth. In addition we collaborated on a number of reviews and tutorials. Some of this work also briefly overlapped with work I conducted with Jennifer McCommas.</description>

      <title>Parent education to improve early language development: A preliminary evaluation of LENA Start™</title>

      <description>Abstract   Parents play an important role in creating home language environments that promote language development. A nonequivalent group design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based implementation of LENA Start™, a parent-training program aimed at increasing the quantity of adult words (AWC) and conversational turns (CT). Parent-child dyads participated in LENA Start™ (n = 39) or a generic parent education program (n = 17). Overall, attendance and engagement in the LENA Start™ program were high: 72% of participants met criteria to graduate from the program.</description>

      <description>Abstract   Caregivers need support with teaching augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). The purpose of this study was to coach caregivers via telehealth (i.e., live video conferencing with Google Hangout) to implement communication assessments, functional communication training (FCT), and/or navigation training to address either idiosyncratic or problem behavior exhibited by two young boys with developmental delay (age 5.5 years) and autism (age 7 years) who were non-verbal. An adapted multiple probe design and a multiple probe design across three contexts (play, break from demands, help) were used to evaluate acquisition of communicative requests using high tech aided AAC on a speech-generating device (SGD; a Tobii Dynavox T10 device).</description>

      <title>Coaching parents to assess and treat self‐injurious behaviour via telehealth</title>
      <link>marianne-elmquist.com/publications/bensonetal2018/</link>

      <description>Abstract   The application of telehealth technology to conduct functional analysis (FA) and functional communication training (FCT) is emerging for children with developmental disabilities and behaviour support needs. The current study was designed to extend FA + FCT for self-injurious behaviour by using telehealth in home with parents as interventionists receiving real-time remote coaching. Two families with school-aged boys with developmental disabilities associated with intellectual disability participated, one with cerebral palsy and the other with autism spectrum disorder.</description>
