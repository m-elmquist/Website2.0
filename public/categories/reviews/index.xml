      <description>During my Ph.D. I worked on a few projects with Liza Finestack in the Speech-Language-Hearing Science department at the University of Minnesota.
LENA Start™ Smarter Happier Baby Evaluation     Project Description: Along with Scott McConnell, Amanda Kriese, and Erin Lease, we ( Liza and myself) conducted a preliminary evaluation of LENA Start™ being implemented in community settings. We partnered with local Early Childhood Family Education (ECFE) programs to assess the feasibility of implementing LENA Start™ within ECFE classes.</description>

      <description>Abstract   Purpose of Review. Early, intensive, and high-quality interventions can often improve social communication outcomes for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Many children experience barriers to intervention, resulting in significant delays to intervention onset or missed opportunities for intervention altogether. With constant advances in technology, the field is experiencing a rapid increase in investigation of telehealth applications to intervention delivery. This article highlights the current trends in social communication intervention via telehealth used in early intervention practices for children with ASD over the past 5 years, including a brief review of studies (from 2014 to January 2020) and our team’s experiences in this area.</description>

      <title>Impact of aided AAC interventions on speech comprehension of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities: A critically appraised topic</title>

      <description>Abstract   A critically appraised topic (CAT) is one form of rapid review that can be particularly useful for informing practice. The purpose of this CAT was twofold: to determine (a) the impact of aided augmentative and alternative communication interventions on speech and graphic symbol comprehension in children, aged birth-18 years with neurodevelopmental disabilities and (b) whether there are any potential learner characteristics that serve as moderators or mediators regarding intervention outcomes.</description>

      <title>Maintenance and generalization in functional behavior assessment/behavior intervention plan literature.</title>

      <description>Abstract   School practitioners increasingly use functional behavior assessments to design behavior intervention plans when students engage in challenging behavior that is not improved by classroom management or standard interventions. Behavior intervention plans should aim to produce behavior change that maintains across time and generalizes to relevant contexts. In applied terms, maintenance occurs when a behavior continues to occur after the intervention is fully or partially withdrawn; generalization occurs when a learner engages in a trained behavior in an untrained context.</description>
