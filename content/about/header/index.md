  A little bit more about me and my research...

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
My work is grounded in bioecological, ecobehavioral, and developmental perspectives to examine how the child's environment and language-facilitating interactions shape language development, particularly for children with complex communication needs (CCN) who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies. I'm also interested in the use of technology to deliver parent-implemented communication interventions and its utility in capturing and measuring adult-child language based interactions. Additionally, I'm interested in leveraging recent statistical advances such as data fusion and supervised machine learning methods to further our understanding of the proximal and distal factors influencing language learning to improve future intervention efforts that in turn foster language acquisition for those that require additional supports and resources. 

Outside of work, I can be found outside hiking, biking, canoeing, or backpacking.
