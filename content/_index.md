description: Thanks for stopping by! I'm Marianne Elmquist. Currently, I'm a NIH postdoctoral fellow at the [Waisman Center](https://cow.waisman.wisc.edu/) (UW-Madison). My research focuses on fostering early language acquisition through gaining a better understanding and leveraging contextual influences on language learning. Here, you'll find current and past research projects, publications, and *very* sporadic blog posts. Please feel free to reach out for more info, interest in collaborations, etc.
