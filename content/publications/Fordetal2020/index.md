title: Toward an ecobehavioral model of early language development

# Abstract
Language development is an important milestone in early childhood that has implications for laterachievement. Although a variety of contemporary models have been offered to describe the process oflanguage acquisition, ecobehavioral models provide descriptive and actionable information on both thecausal mechanisms of behavior change and development, as well as variables of influence (e.g., settings,environment, policies). Grounded within sociolinguistic theory and empirical literature, we propose anddescribe an ecobehavioral model of language development that assumes language is learned through theopportunities afforded by caregiverâ€“child interactions. Functional variables of (a) caregiver knowledge,beliefs, and behavior, (b) environmental components and resource availability, and (c) policies and prac-tices are further described as increasingly distal influences on the timing, frequency, and quality of theseinteractions. Implications and future directions are discussed.
