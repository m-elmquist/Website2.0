IGDILab is part of an interdisciplinary, cross-institutional team of researchers developing, validating and applying Individual Growth and Development Indicators (IGDIs) to support data-based decision making to help improve early childhood outcomes. During my time at IGDIlab I primarily worked on the [Age 3 IGDI's](https://innovation.umn.edu/igdi/projects/igdi-pk3/) project, but also briefly helped with the Progress Monitoring IGDI's [(PM-IGDIs)](https://innovation.umn.edu/igdi/progress-monitoring-individual-growth-and-development-indicators-pm-igdis/) project. 

## Age-3-IGDIs

**Project Description:** The purpose of the current project was to downward extend IGDIs to three-year olds. The project consisted of developing and validating age appropriate items to assess early literacy skills in the following domains: oral language, alphabet knowledge, and phonological awareness.
