During my Ph.D. I worked on a few projects with [Liza Finestack](https://twitter.com/lfinestack) in the Speech-Language-Hearing Science department at the University of Minnesota.

## LENA Start™ Smarter Happier Baby Evaluation

**Project Description:** Along with [Scott McConnell](https://twitter.com/srmcconnell), Amanda Kriese, and [Erin Lease](https://twitter.com/erinlease), we ([Liza](https://twitter.com/lfinestack) and myself) conducted a preliminary evaluation of [LENA Start™](https://www.lena.org/lena-start/) being implemented in community settings. We partnered with local Early Childhood Family Education (ECFE) programs to assess the feasibility of implementing LENA Start™  within ECFE classes. LENA Start™ is a standardized community program designed to increase the number of [serve-and-return](https://developingchild.harvard.edu/science/key-concepts/serve-and-return/) interactions between young children and their adult communicative partners and thus improve the home language learning environment and language development.

## Caregiver-focused communication interventions: A scoping review

**Project Description:** Along with [Kirsten Kuchler](https://twitter.com/KirstinKuchler), [Betül Çakır Dilek](https://twitter.com/BetulCakirDilek), and [Andrea Ford](https://twitter.com/AndreaLBFord) we conducted a large scoping review of caregiver-focused communication interventions for children birth through 3 years of age. Our main review question was: 
* What do we know about caregiver intervention/education programs designed to support child language development?
  + What are the intervention/education components?
    - What is the dosage? 
    - What is the service delivery method?
    - Who is the intervention agent?     
  + Do caregiver interventions change caregiver behavior? If so, under what conditions?      
    - What are caregiver characteristics?
    - What are child characteristics?
    - Do caregiver interventions change child language outcomes, if reported?

We were also fortunate to have had the support of a **stellar** team of librarians ([Amy Riegleman](https://twitter.com/amylibrarian), Sarah Jane Brown, and Scott Marsalis). If you're thinking of embarking on any kind of review project, I highly recommend reaching out to your University's Librarians!
